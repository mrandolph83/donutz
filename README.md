# Donutz

A prototype app to order your favorite donuts from your favorite donut shop. This app allows you to know what donuts are still available at the shop, and how many are still left. After placing an order, real-time updates show how many donuts are left after each order is placed.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'donutz'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install donutz

## Usage

Follow the prompts to place an order at the donut shop, and real-time data will update how many of each variety is left. You can also view a description, look at a picture, or get nutritional info on each variety of donut. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
